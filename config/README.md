This is NodeJS project to add video ideas to post on YouTube.
This project was done during a course on NodeJS on Udemy By Brad Traversy.
Vidjot uses MongoDB, Express and Mongoose to create data models, authenticate users, store emails and encrypted passwords in our local database.
Express routing is used to route to Login, Register etc pages.
This has also been deployed using Heroku.

Note - 
For Windows users, to start the MongoDB, 
1) open command prompt as Admin,
2) go to C:\
3) type net start MongoDB

That should run the Mongo server so the app will be able to connect to it
